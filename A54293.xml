            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Account of the Vertues and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> Prepared only by <hi>Chr. Packe,</hi> at his Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, next Door to the <hi>Gun</hi> in <hi>Little-Moor-Fields</hi> near <hi>Moorgate.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AFTER many years Experience of the vertues and worth of this Medicine, in helping and curing many Diſeaſes, to which the Body of man is ſubject, which of late I have alſo much improved and exalted in its Vertues; I have determined at length for a publick Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit (and to excuſe my ſelf from writing many Letters) to publiſh the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is a Salt prepared of Mineral Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by apt Mediums purify'd and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or <hi>Aura vitalis</hi> of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Body, (which is the adequate object of Medicine) and thereby becomes a Salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous remedy enobled with Vertues ſufficient for the curing of many Diſeaſes. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition ariſeth from its Subject, Object, and End.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:94097:3"/>
            <p n="2">II. It is neither an Acid nor an Alcaly, but a Salt of a middle Nature, being able to paſs the ſeveral Digeſtions unchanged, and in its paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to reſolve and abſterge all Preternatural Coagulations, for which Reaſon I call it <hi>Sal Solutivum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. It is endowed with thoſe Four general Properties, <hi>viz. Cathartick, Diuretick, Deob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruent,</hi> and allaying of all <hi>Preternatural heat</hi> and <hi>Acrimony:</hi> Beſides which, as I have now exalted and improved it with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> it is a general eaſer of Pain, and Extinguiſher of Venereal Venoms, that are not grown to a confirm'd Pox, as is manifeſt by what it effects now in allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Pains of the <hi>Gout, Rhumatiſm, Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, Collick, Griping</hi> of the <hi>Guts, Virulent Ghon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norhaea's,</hi> &amp;c. beyond what it could have done heretofore.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly premiſed its Nature and Qualifications in general, for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch Phyſicians as may deſire to make uſe of it; I ſhall now Addreſs my ſelf more particularly to ſhew its Virtues and manner of uſing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> purgeth the groſs Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and moſt viſcous Humours of the firſt paſſages without Nauſeating the Stomach, or the leaſt griping Pains. 2. It is ſingular in opening Obſtructions of the Veſſels and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>era. 3. It purifies and invigorates the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94097:3"/>whole Maſs of Blood, and reſtores it to i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> natural State; for being an amicable Salt, it hath admittance into the Blood, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith of fixed Alcalyes made Volatile, <hi>uſque ad limen quartae Digeſtionis.</hi> But this is deny'd to all ordinary purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, which if through any inadvertency of the <hi>Archeus,</hi> they chance to ſlip into the lacteal Veins, and ſo into the Blood; they cauſe griping Convulſive pains, Stiches, Flux of Blood, Faintings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till Nature hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain diſcharged her ſelf of them; and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of purging the Blood, too often both corrupt and exhauſt it. And theſe two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties are well worth the obſerving, being not to be met with even in the mildeſt of the common <hi>Catharticks.</hi> For this cauſe it is of great uſe in <hi>Fevers,</hi> neither diſturbing the Juices, nor accending the Blood. I have ſeen many Fevers proceeding from Surfeits, both in eating and drinking quickly cured by it, and even Hectick Fevers themſelves in a longer time, but ſuch as I judged to proceed from a Scorbutick or venereal Cauſe: As for thoſe which are wont to accompany a <hi>Pthiſis,</hi> I have had no Experience of it in them, yet I doubt not but even in thoſe it would allay the Preternatural heat.</p>
            <p>But that this Medicine may be given to the beſt advantage, it is neceſſary in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring it, to have regard to two ſpecial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which Phyſicians are wont to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the curing Diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94097:4"/>purging the firſt paſſages, the Stomach and Inteſtines of groſs Excrements and Filths. 2. To open and diſſolve all Stagnant and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing matter in the Viſcera, as the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas, Meſentery, Liver, Spleen, Reins</hi> and <hi>Womb,</hi> and to correct and purifie the Blood, when it decllnes from its natural <hi>Craſis.</hi> The ordinary Doſe of this Salt to purge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>firſt Intention</hi> (which only is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging according to common Acceptation) is from half an Ounce to ſix Drams, diſſolved in a Pint, or a Pint and a half of warm Poſſet-drink, new Whey, or pure Water, and drank in the Morning faſting. Thoſe that cannot take ſuch a quantity of Liquor, may diſſolve their Doſe in half a Pint (which will preſently diſſolve it if it be warmed) and drink another half Pint preſently after it, and a third half an hour after that, and faſt till Dinner-time, except the Patient have a mind to take a Porrenger of Water Gruel, or thin Broth; neither will a draught of Ale, or a Diſh of Tea at all hinder, but promote the working of it. Thoſe who like neither Poſſet-drink, Whey or Water, or want the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of getting them, may take it in Ale, and it will do well enough; although in ſome few Perſons I have known it cauſe a Drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs when taken in ſpirituous Liquors; the Reaſon of which is its partaking of the <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyne Narcotick</hi> Sulphurs of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which readily aſſociate themſelves with the vegetable Sulphurous Spirit, by which they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94097:4"/>are quickly carried to the Brain: yet the uſe which may be made of this in ſome Caſes, is not inconſiderable as is well known to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians.</p>
            <p>This Medicine doth not only gently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and expurge the Excrements of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Guts, but it alſo corrects the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all Preternatural Purges, if you put but two Drams of it in their infuſion, or drink the ſame quantity in a draught of warm Poſſet-drink after Pills which gripe and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Churliſhly; It hath alſo a power of ſtopping the working of Vomits, ſome of which greatly incommode the Stomach, by Vellicating its Membranes, and impreſſing them with a Nauceating Character; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which let two or three Drams of the <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> be diſſolved in half a Pint of cold water, and drank about half an hour before the Vomit is taken. Or in caſe a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit be taken which worketh too violently, or too long, that is when the Stomach is wholly emptied, and yet the Patient continueth to reach, let a Dram and a half, or two Drams of the Salt be diſſolved in a large Glaſs of warm Poſſet-drink, or rather warm Water, (becauſe Poſſet-drink may at that time be diſguſtful) and be drank off. Do the ſame when a Vomit hath done working, and yet the Patient finds a ſwimming or Giddineſs in the Head, or a Nauſeouſneſs, or diſpoſition to Vomit, for the Salt will free the Tunicles of the Stomach, and contract and corroborate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94097:5"/>them, precipitating the offending Particles <hi>per inferior a;</hi> but I add not this to encourage any Body to meddle with ſuch Phyſick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Advice, but to ſhew the ſafety and efficacy of the Medicine. <hi>N.B.</hi> This Salt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves the Belly bound as the common Purges do, but always ſoluble, and is the beſt Remedy that I know againſt a <hi>Coſtive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſecond Intention</hi> is to alter, and open Obſtructions in the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Pancre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Meſentery, Reins, Bladder,</hi> and <hi>Womb;</hi> from which proceed many tedious and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Diſeaſes, as the <hi>Scurvy, Dropſie, Jaundies, Hypocondriack Melancholy, Vapours, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs, Rhumatiſm,</hi> inveterate <hi>Head-ach, Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs, Sleepineſs, Vertigo, Phrenzy, Cramps, Convulſions, Internal Inflammations,</hi> and <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthumes, Piles, Exulcerations</hi> of the <hi>Kidneys</hi> and <hi>Bladder, Gravel,</hi> ſtoppage of <hi>Urine,</hi> &amp;c. together with many others ariſing from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the Blood, and viral Juices.</p>
            <p>In all which the chief end of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine being to reſolve and attenuate the thick and ſtagnant Juices, or Excrements of the ſeveral Digeſtions which lye in the ſmalleſt paſſages, to Contemper any exceſs of quality in the <hi>Bile, Lympha,</hi> and Blood, by mingling it ſelf with the Chyle and Blood, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating it ſelf into the more inward receſſes of the Body, this method is to be obſerved.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94097:5"/>
            <p>Firſt purge the Body with half an Ounce, five or ſix Drams of the Salt (according to the Patients are and ſtrength) diſſolved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Poſſet-drink, Whey, or Water, as you pleaſe, to carry off the groſs Excrements of the firſt paſſages, and to make way for the better Penetration and diſtribution of the Remedy into all the parts of the Body. If the firſt Doſe purge not to your mind, take another the next day, that the aforeſaid end may be anſwered. Then diſſolve the ſame quantity of the Salt you gave to purge in a Quart or three Pints of pure water, and let the Patient take a third part of it the ſame Night, after the purge three hours after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, another third part the next Morning early before he riſeth, that he may ſleep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and the remaining third part in the Day-time between Meals, and this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a Week, Fortnight or three Weeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as occaſion ſhall require. But becauſe ſome Patients cannot drink any conſiderable quantity of water, without nauſeating or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconveniency to their Bodies, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician may accommodate the quantity of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his own liking, provided he order but enough to diſſolve it well, that it may not taſte too ſtrong.</p>
            <p>This Salt anſwers all the ends of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral-Waters,</hi> both purging and Chaly beat; beſides, and beyond which it hath ſome Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, one of which is the certainty of its Nature and Operations, the which cannot

Beſides the Patient is obliged to drink a large quantity of the <hi>Mineral Waters,</hi> or they will not work, which if they do not, they cauſe Gripings, Stiches, Sleepineſs, Feveriſh Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and other inconveniences, ariſing from the Crudity of the Minerals, as well as from the quantity of the Water; eſpecially the Chalybeat, which alſo require purging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore, and after a Courſe of drinking them, to prevent ſome hurts, which otherwiſe might ariſe by their uſe; which every one is excuſed from in the uſe of this Salt, for where a large quantity of water is not convenient for the Patient, a Quart, a Pint and a half, yea even a Pint may ſerve, this being alſo its own purge: Beſides it being free from Mineral Crudity, and wholly pure and friendly to Nature, can never do hurt, but always good, by being long retain'd in the Body. Nor is it to be reckoned amongſt the ſmalleſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to thoſe who are confin'd to a place by Buſineſs, or by the Narrowneſs of their Fortune, that they may take this artificial Mineral-Water, at all times of the year, and in all places, without loſs of time, hinderance of buſineſs, or the charge of Coach-hire to and from the Wells, or more chargeable maintaining themſelves there.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:94097:6"/>
            <p>If you would uſe it inſtead of the purging Waters, as <hi>Epſome, Dulwich, Northall,</hi> &amp;c. diſſolve ſix Drams, or three quarters of an Ounce of the Salt, in the ſame quantity of pure Spring-water, as would be fit for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of any of the purging Waters, <hi>viz.</hi> from three Pints to three Quarts, ordering him to drink it by degrees in the Morning, in the ſpace of an hour and a half, or two hours, and to walk, or uſe ſome Exerciſe in the open Air (provided it be in the Summer time) and to order himſelf as if he were drinking the Mineral purging Waters.</p>
            <p>But if you would have it anſwer the end of the Chalybeat waters; as the <hi>German-Spaw, Tunbridge, Iſlington,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> to purge but little by Stool, but to alter and open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, then uſe it as in the ſecond gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Direction already given.</p>
            <p>Now although this Salt be of great uſe and ſervice in very many diſeaſes, yet I have by long Experience obſerved, that in ſome it is ſpecifically potent; as in the <hi>Scurvy, Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Dropſie, Hyſterical Suffocations,</hi> Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Vapours, <hi>Green-ſickneſs,</hi> ſtoppage of the <hi>Menſes, Piles, Ghonnorrhaea, Collick, Diarrhaea, Bloody Flux, Griping</hi> of the <hi>Guts, Worms</hi> of all ſorts, old <hi>Head-achs, Inflammations</hi> and <hi>Rhumes</hi> of the <hi>Eyes, Itch,</hi> and <hi>Cholerick Erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi> ſtoppage and heat of <hi>Urine.</hi> In all which Caſes I may truly ſay, it hath ſignaliz'd it ſelf, and often exceeded my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations. And although from the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94097:7"/>already given, any one may eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the way of giving it in thoſe Diſeaſes, yet for the publick Good I ſhall be ſomewhat more particular.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> I firſt purge the Patient with a Doſe or two of <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſecond general Direction; then I diſſolve an Ounce of it in a Quart of pure water, by ſhaking them together in a Bottle till all the Salt is diſſolved, and then order the Patient to drink half a Pint of the ſame at night going to Bed, and another half Pint early in the Morning, ſo that half an Ounce of the Salt is taken in a day, and this I continue daily for a Month or ſix Weeks, according to the age and ſtrength of the Diſeaſe, ordering the Patient beſides to drink a pure and well rectify'd <hi>Volatile Spirit of Salt,</hi> in all his drink as well at meats as at other times, ten or twelve Drops at a time or more, ſo that he may drink the quantity of forty or fifty Drops in a day, (which Spirit of Salt may be had at my Houſe ſealed up in Glaſſes with printed Directions for its uſe. Price of each Glaſs a Shilling) for ſuch as have the <hi>Scurvy</hi> manifeſted in their Mouths, by Soreneſs of the Gums, and their readineſs to bleed upon every light occaſion; I order an Ounce of the salt to be diſſolved in a Pint of warm water, and the Mouth to be well waſhed with ſome of that water warm two or three times a day.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94097:7"/>
            <p>In the <hi>Jaundies,</hi> I give it in Summer in Water or Whey, in Winter in warm Poſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink, every other day five or ſix Drams, or two days together (according as it works) then intermit a day and give it again, and on the intermitting days half the Doſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the uſe of it, till the Yellowneſs and Faintneſs ceaſe.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> I give it in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as in the <hi>Jaundies,</hi> only in a leſs quantity of the <hi>Vehicle.</hi> I have cured both the <hi>Aſcites</hi> and the <hi>Anaſarca</hi> with it, but thwether it will do ought in a <hi>Tympany,</hi> I know not; having never given it that I remember in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, for in that I am wont to uſe my <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Univerſale, Species Univerſalis,</hi> and <hi>Tinctura Regalis.</hi> But in an <hi>Aſcites,</hi> whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an Obſtruction of the <hi>Liver, Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> or <hi>Ureters,</hi> or from a Rupture of the <hi>Vaſa Lymphatica,</hi> from their two great Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; (from which laſt I perſwade my ſelf more Dropſies do ariſe than from any other cauſe) this Medicine anſwers all the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of cure, becauſe it not only opens all Obſtructions, and pleaſantly reduceth the water, but alſo by its ſtrengthning and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamick Virtue, Conglutinates the breaches of thoſe Veſſels, and Remedies the too great laxity of the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> having all the Vertues of a compleat vulnerary Medicine, as I ſhall have occaſion to ſhew by and by, when I come to ſpeak of its external uſe.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:94097:8"/>
            <p>In <hi>Hyſterical Suffocations,</hi> commonly called Fits of the Mother, and Melancholy Vapours, I give two or three Drams diſſolved in a Pint and a half, or a Quart of pure water up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the approach of the Fit, or if that cannot be, as ſoon as the Fit is off, and in the time of the Fit (when greater quantities cannot be got down) I order the Diſſolution of the Salt in water to be given by Spoonfulls. The next day I purge with the whole Doſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in a Quart of water. And for as much as thoſe ſuffocating Fumes are cauſed by Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and Fuliginous matter remaining in the ſmall Veſſels, where they ferment from time to time, cauſing a puffing up, and Senſe of fulneſs (eſpecially ſometime after eating) it is neceſſary to take the Salt daily for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, to open and carry off the Obſtructions as in the ſecond general Direction; by this means their frequent Returns may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by extirpating the Evil which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (in thoſe diſmal oppreſſions to the poor female Sex) is but only palliated.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Green-ſickneſs</hi> in Maids, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to diſſolve an Ounce of the Salt in a Quart of pure water, and to take half a Pint of the water at night going to Bed, and the ſame quantity early the next Morning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this Courſe daily for three, four, or five Weeks if need be, not omitting to purge the Patient firſt with a full Doſe or two at the beginning, as in the ſecond general Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as alſo two or three days before the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94097:8"/>full of the Moon, that Nature may be the more effectually helped in this way of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating. Where the <hi>Menſes</hi> are only ſtopt, it is to be taken as in the ſecond general Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for Obſtructions; beſides which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is to be purged once or twice with the full Doſe, two or three days before her month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time of Expectancy. This Medicine is alſo of ſingular uſe for thoſe Women whoſe Months are about to leave them, in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many diſorders which are occaſioned thereby; in which caſe it is to be taken once or twice to the quantity of half an Ounce, or five or ſix Drams for three or ſour Months ſucceſſively, about the time when they ought to flow. I have known ſome Women of Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of Age, who have by the uſe of this Medicine ſeemed again in that reſpect to grow young. I have alſo eaſily and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with this Salt delivered ſome Women of falſe Great Bellies.</p>
            <p>About two Months ſince, I gave three quarters of an Ounce of <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> to a Maid about twenty one years of Age, who had a very ill habit of Body, and a pale ſickly Complexion, having never had the Courſe of Nature in due order or quantity, and for ſome Months paſt totally ſuppreſſed. She was now ſeized with a grievous pain in her Right ſide, emulating an illegitimate Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie, which (as ſhe told me) had frequently aſſaulted her for ſome Months paſt, for the removing which Pain I gave her the Salt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94097:9"/>which gave her ſeven or eight Stools before Noon without any Sickneſs or Griping, by which time her Pain was quite gone out of her ſide: She eat ſome Dinner, and about two hours afterwards diſcharged her Stomach by Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a great quantity of filthy green Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after which ſhe had two or three Stools more, with which her <hi>Menſes</hi> came down plentifully, which with her often going to the Vault occaſioned her catching of Cold, and a ſore Throat. I ordered ſhe ſhould have ſomewhat warm and comfortable, and go to Bed, and keep very warm the next day which ſhe did; the Night following (ſhe ſtill complaining of her Throat, and a Soreneſs all over her Bones, (as ſhe phras'd it) I ordered her ten Grains of my <hi>Pilula Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica</hi> which ſweat her very plentifully; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her ſweating her natural Purgations were but little, but as ſoon as that was over they returned again, continuing for a due time, ſince which ſhe hath remained well.</p>
            <p>It is a ſingular Remedy for the <hi>Worms</hi> of all ſorts, killing them and reſolving them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Slime, and purging their putrid Matter out of the Body. To Children from three years of Age to ſeven, I give from a Dram and a half to three Drams, from ſeven to fourteen, half an Ounce, from fourteen to twenty, or more, from half an Ounce, to three quarters of an Ounce, or ſix Drams diſſolved in fair Water, Whey or Poſſet-drink, and continued every day for a Week together.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94097:9"/>Where it is difficult to get Children to take it, a little Sugar may be added to the Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to make it the pleaſanter. My <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> alſo effecteth the ſame in a longer time in thoſe Children which cannot be perſwaded to take the Salt, which they may take in all their drink, and not diſcern it. The Salt and this Spirit uſed together are ſtill more effectual.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Piles</hi> I give a quarter of an Ounce of the Salt diſſolved in half a Pint of water in Summer time, or warm Poſſet-drink in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which juſt keeps the Belly ſoluble, and by dulcifying the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the protruded Blood takes away the Pain and Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; beſides which, if the <hi>Piles</hi> be outward, I order them to be often embrocated with my <hi>Aqua Phagadenica,</hi> and fine Rags to be laid upon them wet in the ſame water: but if they be within the <hi>Anus,</hi> then I order the ſame wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be warmed, and injected by a Syringe twice or thrice a day, and a Rag three or ſour times double well wetted in the ſame to be applied outwardly, and by this Courſe the <hi>Piles</hi> by degrees dwindle and ſhrink up like dryed Grapes. This Courſe hath never failed me, but hath been effectual even when the <hi>Piles</hi> have been inveterate and fiſtulated. To thoſe who are ſubject to the <hi>Piles,</hi> I adviſe the daily uſe of my <hi>Volatile Spirit of Salt</hi> in all their Drink, to the quantity of thirty or forty Drops a day, it is far better in this Diſeaſe than any Diet-drink.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:94097:10"/>
            <p>In <hi>Virulent Ghennerheas</hi> or <hi>Claps,</hi> I give firſt ſix Drams of the Salt diſſolved in fair water in Summer, or in a Pint of warm Poſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink in Winter, ordering the Patient to drink another Pint within an hour after, then I give half an Ounce ſo diſſolved every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a Pint of the <hi>Vehicle</hi> continuing it till all the heat and ſharpneſs is gone, and the Gleet fit to be ſtopt, which ſometimes will be in a Week, ſometimes a Fortnight or three Weeks, according as it is of ſhorter or longer ſtanding, or the Diſeaſyfying-power milder or ſtronger; for it pleaſantly and effectually educeth the venereal Venome, purifyeth the Seed, and ſtrengtheneth the Spermatick Veſſels. But when the Iſſuing is fit to be ſtopt, I give my <hi>Balſamum ad Ghonnorhaeam</hi> every night at going to Bed, from twenty to forty Drops mixt with a little Sugar, and half an Ounce of the Salt every other Morning. But where a <hi>Ghonnorhaea</hi> hath not been taken in time, or hath been unduly ſtopt, ſo that it be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into an incipient Pox, and I find by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſix or ſeven Doſes of the Salt that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach it, then I have recourſe to purging and ſweating, alternately with my <hi>Manna Mercurii,</hi> and <hi>Aurum vitae Bezoardicum,</hi> which uſually effects the Cure to ſatisfaction But in a <hi>Chonnorhaea</hi> unduly ſtopt, (known for the moſt part at the firſt by a painful Tumour in the Groyn) when it hath not exceeded a Month, three, four, or five Doſes of this Salt will ſet it a running again, and aftewards Cure it, being
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94097:10"/>uſed as above with the Balſome, but in longer time. I have known ſome who have fallen into the hands of Men either unskilful in this matter, or worſe, who have endeavoured to diſcuſs thoſe Tumours, which themſelves have made by their unſeaſonable ſtopping of a <hi>Ghonnorhaea,</hi> and have ſometimes effected it ſo well, as when the Patient hath thought himſelf cured of a Clap, he hath ſoon after been attacked by the Symptoms of the Pox, and ſo the laſt Error of the Phyſician was worſe than the firſt.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Chollick</hi> or <hi>Griping</hi> of the <hi>Guts,</hi> where there is great pain, I diſſolve ſix Drams or three quarters of an Ounce of the Salt in a Quart of hot ſpring water, and order the Patient to drink three or four Glaſſes in the ſpace of half an hour, as hot as he can: But if there be Vomiting let it be drank more lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurely, <hi>viz.</hi> A quarter of a Pint once in a quarter of an hour till the Vomiting ceaſe, then take notice how much of the Medicine hath been vomited up, and give ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the Patient may have the full Doſe. If in the water you intend to diſſolve the Salt in, you firſt boyl the bruiſed Seeds of <hi>Aniſe,</hi> ſweet <hi>Fennel, Carraway</hi> and <hi>Coriander,</hi> a Dram or two Drams of each, to a Quart of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it will be the better, becauſe thoſe Seeds have a peculiar Virtue of pacifying the Exorbitant fury of the <hi>Pylorus;</hi> you may put in the Salt in the boyling, which will extract the Vertues of the Seeds, ſooner and better
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94097:11"/>than water alone can do. But beware that you neither boyl, infuſe or warm any Liquor in which the Salt is, in Braſs or Copper Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, but in Silver, Tin or Earth, leſt it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the the Metal ſomewhat diſagreeable to the Stomach. It uſually eaſeth the pain in two or three hours time, ſometimes ſooner, but where the Stomach will not retain it, or it doth not overcome and expell the obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, in a few hours time, I give a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Doſe, and if that fail (as I have ſome few times ſeen in the <hi>dry Gripes</hi> and <hi>Wind Chollick</hi>) then I have recourſe to my <hi>Arcanum Univerſale,</hi> which (Bleſſed be the Almighty) hath not that I remember ever failed me. Note that after the Pains are allay'd, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to purge the Body divers times, with the Salt diſſolved in the aforementioned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Seeds, to carry off the remaining Excrements, which otherwiſe, retaining a diſeaſy Ferment, may ſoon cauſe a freſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. But in a bilious <hi>Chollick,</hi> known by bitterneſs of the Mouth, Vomiting, Yellowneſs of the Skin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may leave out the Seeds and give it in water only, the Seeds being more preciſely adapted to the help of the <hi>Wind Chollick, Gripes, Illiack Paſſion,</hi> &amp;c. yet they are endowed with a general Vertue of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the <hi>Pylorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a <hi>Diarrhaea</hi> or common Looſeneſs, boyl ſome Bran in pure water, ſtrain the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in a Pint of it diſſolve three Drams of the Salt, and drink it up at twice, at three
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94097:11"/>or four hours diſtance: do this three or four times over if need be. But in a <hi>Dyſentery</hi> or <hi>Bloody-Flux,</hi> I give the Salt diſſolved in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of red Roſe leaves: half an Ounce a day as long as it is required, after both which, the Patient muſt be purged with the whole Doſe diſſolved in a Quart of the ſame Decoction, in which it was given before to ſweeten the <hi>Acrimony.</hi> In the <hi>Bloody-Flux,</hi> I have given ſix Drams of it Clyſter-wiſe in the foreſaid Decoction, beſides giving it at the Mouth by two Drams at a time twice a day, and that with great Succeſs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Headachs, Inflammations</hi> and <hi>Rhumes</hi> in the <hi>Eyes,</hi> I give five or ſix Drams every other day ſo long as there is need, many of which it hath taken away at three or four times ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But as an Auxiliary Topick, in <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> and <hi>Rhumes</hi> of the <hi>Eyes,</hi> I order a few drops of my <hi>Aqua Opthalmica,</hi> to be dropt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eyes two or three times a day.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Itch, Botches, Boyls,</hi> and other <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick Eruptions</hi> of the <hi>Skin,</hi> I give half an Ounce or five Drams every day, diſſolved in a Quart or three Pints of water or New Whey in the Morning, as the Mineral-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for a Week, Fortnight, Three weeks, or a Month together, as the greatneſs of the Diſeaſe requires: In thoſe Caſes it cannot be enough commended. It hath cured ſome that have been adjudged Leprous. In thoſe Diſeaſes I order together with it my <hi>Volatile Spirit</hi> of <hi>Salt</hi> to be taken inwardly, as in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94097:12"/>
               <hi>Scurvy,</hi> and my <hi>Aqua Phagadenica</hi> to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed outwardly, by waſhing with it twice a day.</p>
            <p>In Heat or Gravel in the <hi>Kidneys,</hi> or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page or heat of <hi>Urine,</hi> firſt I purge the Body with one whole Doſe, then diſſolve an Ounce in a Quart of water in Summer, or warm Poſſet-drink in Winter, and let the Patient drink half a Pint at night going to Bed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo early in the Morning; beſides which I order thirty or forty drops a day of my <hi>Volatile Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of <hi>Salt,</hi> continuing the uſe of thoſe, till all the Preternatural heat be gone, the Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions opened, or Gravel ceaſeth to come away.</p>
            <p>Thus I have in as brief a manner as I could, ſet down my Experiences of the internal uſe of this Medicine, wherein I am not Conſcious to my ſelf, that I have in any thing commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it beyond its juſt merit. I ſhall in the next place and ſomewhat concerning its external Vertues and Uſe; to which by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion and Confirmation, I ſhall ſubjoyn the Obſervations of ſome learned and skilful Phyſicians concerning its Vertues, which they have been ſo kind to Communicate to me for the publick Good.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the External uſe of <hi>Sal Solutivum.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>This Salt hath its peculiar Excellencies in Chyrurgery, as well as in Phyſick; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtops bleeding; cures an ordinary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94097:12"/>Wound, whether inciſed or contuſed, at one ſingle dreſſing, but if the Wound be large and lacerated (provided it be timely and duly applyed) at two or three dreſſings, as I my ſelf have divers times ſeen. It takes away all Inflammation and pain from the Wound in half an hours time, never ſuffering it to come to Suppuration, but cures it by the firſt Intention. There are three ways of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, to apply it to Wounds.</p>
               <p>The firſt is to take ſome of the <hi>Chryſtalline Salt</hi> in the Summer time, and ſpread it thin in a broad Glaſs diſh, or Earthen one glazed, and expoſe it to the Sun all day, ſtirring it now and then, and covering it with a clean Paper, to keep any duſt from falling into it, and in a few days you will have it come to a Powder like fine Flower, when it is brought to this ſtate, I believe it will perform all things which are rightly aſcribed to the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetick powder; but this I leave and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the Tryal of the ingenious; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, if any ſhall be ſo generous to Communicate to me any effects of this Salt, which may be of further uſe to the publick, they ſhall be thankfully received, and again improved to that end. The Second way is to put ſome of the Salt into double Papers, about half an Ounce or leſs in a paper, and wear it ſome time in the Pocket, that the warmth of the Body may ſupply the place of the Suns heat, and in like manner bring it to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable powder, and this may be done in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94097:13"/>Winter-time without attendance or trouble. The third way is to diſſolve four Ounces of the Salt in a Quart of warm water, put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Bottle and ſhaking it till it is all diſſolved, and keeping it cloſe ſtopt for uſe. The firſt way it is moſt powerful, the laſt, or the leaſt Efficacy, but either way will well ſerve.</p>
               <p>For a ſmall <hi>Wound</hi> or <hi>Hurt</hi> take a little of the powder of the firſt or ſecond Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and lay it upon the Wound pretty thick, and bind it on cloſe, ſo that no Air may come in, and let it continue on till 'tis healed, which will quickly be, but it is convenient to let it remain on for two or three days, that it may be confirmed. If at any time when you take off the dreſſing, you find in a <hi>Cut</hi> that it is not ſufficiently conſolidated, or in a <hi>Bruiſe,</hi> that all the Soreneſs and Blackneſs is not gone, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply a little more of the Medicine, and let it lye till the Hurt is quite well. But if you have not the powder of the firſt or ſecond Preparation, then take a pledget of Lint or fine Tow, or a fine linnen Rag three or four times double, which let be well and throughly wetted with the water of the third Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and apply that to the Hurt as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which once in twelve hours or oftner, if need be, you may moiſten all over with ſome of the ſame water, without opening it if the Wound be large. Where the Wound is large or lacerated, firſt let it be clean waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with warm Urine, ſo that it may be freed from Dirt or other extraneous Matter, then
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94097:13"/>take ſuch a quantity of the powder, as you think neceſſary well to cover the Wound, and mix it with ſo much of the White of an Egg (firſt well beat till it be thin) as will make it into the Conſiſtency of a pretty thin Liniment, which ſpread upon fine Tow, or fine Linnen, and apply it to the Wound with convenient Bandage, letting it remain two or three days before you open it, except in that time you find any conſiderable pain, which if you do, it is a Sign that the Air hath acceſs to the Wound, and then open it and preſently apply a freſh dreſſing, as cloſe as poſſibly you can. Note, that if there be in the Wound ſuch torn ragged Fleſh, that hath taken Air, and you judge uncapable of Conglutination, take it off with your Sciſſers before you apply the dreſſing. If you have not the powder, then uſe the water as above directed. The powder will anſwer all the Intentions of cure in an Amputation, being duly applyed with good Bandage.</p>
               <p>It cures <hi>Ruptures</hi> in Children, if the Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be firſt put up, and then the powder mixt with the White of an Egg (as for a Wound) and applyed to the <hi>Scrotum</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> (as the Rupture is) with convenient Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and renewed every fourth day, and the Salt daily taken inwardly diſſolved in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Comfry-Roots, ſo much as may juſt keep the Belly looſe, but not purge; for the ſtraining of the Abdominal Muſcles in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Stool is a great hinderance to the Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutinating
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94097:14"/>of <hi>Ruptures.</hi> Suppoſe the Child be two or three years of Age, diſſolve half an Ounce of the Salt in a pint of the Decoction, and give the Child three Spoonfuls of it Night and Morning, renewing the Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Salt againſt that is done, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Courſe for ſix weeks, and by Gods bleſſing the Cure will be effected. If the Child be younger two Spoonfuls may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, if elder, you muſt give it more accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Rules before given, varied with Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>It alſo effects the ſame in <hi>Fractures</hi> of <hi>Bones,</hi> being uſed in the ſame manner, both inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly, for it powerfully aſſiſteth Nature, in forming the Callous, and alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth <hi>Fevers,</hi> which not ſeldom happen upon thoſe Accidents.</p>
               <p>Half a Grain or a Grain at a time, of the Powder may be blown up into the Noſtrils daily Night and Morning, to ſerve as an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rbine</hi> or ſneezing Medicine, for it pleaſantly and copiouſly evacuateth ſuperfluous Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, by which it cureth <hi>Catarrhs,</hi> it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo taken inwardly every other day for ſome time, in ſuch a quantity as may give three or four Stools, which is ordinarily done with half an Ounce. It gives preſent eaſe in the <hi>Toothach,</hi> about a Dram of the powder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tied up in a fine Rag, and apply'd to the pained Tooth; but this is to be underſtood when the <hi>Toothach</hi> proceeds from a ſharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, irritating the Nerves which are inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94097:14"/>into their Roots, but not of the pain of a hollow or rotten Tooth, excepting that in thoſe it may give ſome ſhort eaſe: but it is neceſſary beſides to purge two or three times with the full Doſe of the Salt, to dulcifie and carry off the ſharpneſs which cauſeth the Pain.</p>
               <p>I could here ſet down many more Uſes of this benign Salt; but becauſe they are not preciſely uſeful to a Phyſician or Chirurgeon, I ſhall leave them to ſome other opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, till I ſee what Reception the things I have already publiſhed concerning it, will meet with, and ſubjoyn the following Accounts which I have received of it from others.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Have much to ſay in the Commendation of <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> in general, but eſpecially on its tranſcendent Effects (by the Bleſſing of the Almighty) on two late Patients of mine; the one in a putrid <hi>Fever,</hi> occaſioned by a Surfeit; the other of an <hi>Athletick</hi> habit of Body, being <hi>Aſthmatick,</hi> and afflicted with a painful <hi>Tumour</hi> in <hi>Ano.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Patients had been under the hands of two other Phyſicians, for ſeven or eight days, who after they had skinn'd him alive left him to combat with Death, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be cured. The method they took was this, firſt they preſcribed him a Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, ordering the Sweat to be promoted for ſeveral hours, the ſame Evening they gave him a Clyſter, the ſecond day another Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the third day another, after which they opened a Vein in his Arm, not omitting Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, Night draughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After his ſecond Clyſter he fell into gripings of the Bowels, then they followed him with more appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Clyſters, and other Medicines inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhibited for that purpoſe. After bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he fell delirious, even to a full Diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to remedy which they bliſtered him in divers places, but all in vain, which they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, put him under the Sentence of Death and ſo left him. In this condition he had remained
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94097:17"/>ſeveral days when I was ſent for to him. When I came, I greatly blamed the Phyſicians to their Faces, for that they judging his Diſeaſe to ariſe from a Surfeit, had not in the firſt place diſcharged the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of Concoction, and not to have drawn the Crudities by Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters into the Guts, and then for their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and ill timed Sweating of him, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all for their bleeding him, which ſoon ſuckt in the Defilements of a corrupted <hi>Chyle</hi> into the Veins, and put the whole Maſs of Blood into a Ferment. They made little op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Charge, and the ſole care of the Patient was put upon me. He was ſtill in a diſtracted Condition, and his Eye-ſight quite taken away, yet finding by his pulſe that he had ſtrength enough to bear the <hi>Sal-Solutivum,</hi> I gave him a Doſe, which in an hour gave him a motion to Stool, and within four hours gave him ſix Stools to my great ſatisfaction; about the end of which time the Patient fell into a ſound and quiet Sleep, I then again feelling his pulſe, told his Relations he would have no more raving Fits, which (praiſed be the Almighty) accordingly happened, nor did I beſides this Adminiſter any thing, but a little Cordial impregnated with your <hi>Elixir Proprietatis volatil</hi> to his full Recovery.</p>
               <p>Being juſt now ſent for to viſit a Patient, I have not time to write more, concerning thoſe two Cures above ſaid, but the Perſons are now both in good Health.</p>

A Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Phyſicians advice was taken, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with pearl Cordials, <hi>Anti-Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> and <hi>Hyſterick</hi> Remedies to appeaſe the fury of the Spirits, but without Succeſs; for on the contrary the Fits came on with greater violence, and ſhe alſo in the interſpace grew gradually ſo Melancholy, till at laſt ſhe became as dumb to almoſt all Diſcourſe. I being ſent for, after Enquiry into the Nature of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and the Remedies which had been Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred; I found that ſhe had a Suppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her <hi>Menſes</hi> for ſome Months before; ſhe alſo being of a Sanguine Complexion: But ſoon after I came, perceiving one of her Fits a coming, I gave her thirty drops of your <hi>Elixir Epilepticum,</hi> which no ſooner was warm in her Stomach, but the Fit gradually remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and thereupon her Fits of both ſorts wholly ceaſed; but the pain of her Spleen, obſtruction of the Womb, and the abounding of Melancholy remained, neither had ſhe the benefit of Stools as uſual. I conſidering it was near the prime of the Moon, adviſed a Clyſter for that Evening, and the next Morning ſix Drams of <hi>Sal Solutivum.</hi> And whereas ſhe was before confin'd to her Bed, lying with a Melancholy Eye fixt upon the Wall, I ordered her to riſe, and to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in ſome Houſhold buſineſs, or to walk with a Companion in the Fields, which ſhe accordingly did. The third day after, coming
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94097:18"/>again to ſee her, and enquiring of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her Phyſick, I was inform'd, that the Salt had given her two or three Vomits, (which way of working is unuſual with it) with ſeveral Stools, and yeſterday (ſaid her Mother) her Terms came down in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, more than ever ſhe had at once in her life, and ſtill flow; and the continual pain in her Side is abated. Notwithſtanding things promiſed ſo well, I adviſed her to take two or three Doſes more of the Salt, (as knowing it an Efficacious Medicine both for the Spleen and Womb, and alſo in Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Caſes) and alſo proſcribed her a ſmall Cordial of <hi>Cephalick, Splenetick</hi> and <hi>Cardiack</hi> waters, with an Addition of one Dram of your <hi>Elixir Proprietatis Volatile.</hi> I ordered a Doſe of the Salt every other Morning, and the Cordial four or five times a day on the intermitting days. And ſo by the bleſſing of God by the uſe of theſe only, ſhe was in a ſhort time reſtored to perfect Health. The <hi>Convulſive</hi> and <hi>Hyſterick Paſſions</hi> being occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by an <hi>Idea</hi> of Fear, were the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited from the defect of the Womb, which only being reſtored to its right Office by the Salt, and the pain of the Spleen removed, the <hi>Idea</hi> gradually vaniſh'd, for which reaſons I do attribute the Cure chiefly thereunto, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſince, that <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> would have performed the Cure alone, if the drops had not been uſed. But for Diſeaſes of the Womb, I have obſerved it to be extraordinary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94097:19"/>when given about the Change or Full of the Moon, whoſe influence upon that part is very remarkable.</p>
               <p>I have by me near forty Obſervations more of Cures (wherein <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> hath been uſed) in different Conſtitutions, Ferments and Diſeaſes, as well complicate as Simple, but becauſe other Medicines have been uſed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Salt, I ſhall forbear to add any of them except you deſire it. But as to particulars let this following Account ſerve for all; it being a Cure performed by it upon my own Body, and for the greatneſs of it deſerves to be put as a Frontiſpiece before the reſt: Take it thus. At firſt I had a ſmall pain for ſome hours, with a gentle Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which encreaſing after one day broke forth into Pimples, and ſome Puſtles near the <hi>Spina Dorſi</hi> on the right ſide, with a gradual and daily boring as with an Augur inwardly from that part, until by the third day it had reached in a ſtrait line, the right ſide of the <hi>Umbilicus:</hi> The Superficies of each pained part, I could have covered with a Crown piece. I concluded theſe to be the Symptoms of an Impoſthumous or Ulcerous ferment, to me almoſt equally dangerous; for conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that my Stomach frequently abounded with a Scorbutick Acidity, I was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Danger, in promoting Maturation if A poſthumous, and that the Acidities of the Stomach would be as vexatious to an <hi>Ulcer,</hi> if not in the firſt place altered. Under this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94097:19"/>thoughtfulneſs, I call'd to mind the Nature of <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> the which altho' I had often adminiſtred to others, yet had not taken four Doſes thereof my Self for divers years: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, becauſe of its gentle Solutive quality, and the rather for that I knew by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in a Saline Scorbutick habit it hath abated the ſaltneſs and ſharpneſs of the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha.</hi> Therefore (God me ſo directing) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved forthwith, to rely upon the ſole uſe of <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> (at which time my Diſtemper had not exceeded four days) and preſently diſſolved a Doſe thereof in warm Poſſet-drink being early in the Morning, which wrought very little, nor was my pains leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but rather encreaſed for that day. —At Evening therefore I ſwallowed four Pills of <hi>Species Univerſalis,</hi> and the pain for that Night (the Pills having no Action) became almoſt intolerable. The next Morning I took a larger Doſe of the Salt, and felt in its Operation ſome eaſe before Noon: The ſame day at Evening I took another Doſe, which after two or three Motions gave me far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eaſe than the former, ſo that I reſted pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty well that Night. The next Morning I found more of Soreneſs and Tenderneſs than pain. Thus I continued to take the Salt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Morning and Night (except the firſt Night that I took the Pills) till my whole ſtock was ſpent, which was but five Doſes, which I made up ſix by borrowing a Doſe of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94097:20"/>one of my Patients, to whom I had before preſcribed ſome Doſes of this Medicine, by which time all my pain was happily and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally removed. Firſt the pain near the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, gradually remitted inwardly as it encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and afterwards that near my Back. For the firſt three days my Excrements continued Foetid, Crude and Slimy, the fourth day the ordure became laudable enough, nor have I had ever ſince the leaſt Symtom of pain in thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>One thing worthy of Obſervation hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the curing of this Diſtemper by the Salt, which is, that it alſo met with another at that time altogether unthought of, which I hope it hath eradicated, I having been free from it ever ſince: It was a <hi>Tetanus</hi> or <hi>Cramp,</hi> an old and frequent Concomitant of the <hi>Scurvy;</hi> I either had it in my Fingers when writing, in my Throat when yawning, in my Thighs when ſtretching them down in the Bed; once in almoſt all the Muſculous parts of my Body, occaſioned by the taking of a Vomit many years ſince. When on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back by turning my ſelf about, it would preſently ſeize either my Neck, Shoulders or Side, ſo frequent and troubleſome was it to me; although by things inwardly taken, and outwardly applyed, it would perhaps remit its rigour for a week or more at a time ſometimes, nevertheleſs it would at other times within that Compaſs give me freſh On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94097:20"/>to my exceeding great trouble and pain: But now (bleſſed be the thrice glorious Name of God) I am freed from it with a Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and renewing of my Health.</p>
               <p>One thing more worthy to be obſerved, which I had almoſt forgot, is this, I had long had a <hi>Carnous Tumur,</hi> occaſioned at the firſt as I ſuppoſe by a wrench or ſtrain of my Back, this continued ſometime after the beginning very painful, after that a ſmall <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle</hi> like a <hi>Wen</hi> ariſing from the <hi>Spine,</hi> near the upper <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the Loyns on the left Side. Some Months after this, a ſtretching pain with a <hi>Tumour,</hi> from that part reached ſtraightway the length of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> which gradually Tumify'd to the Magnitude of a Childs Arm, in a Pyramidal or Conical figure, whoſe leſſer end began from that <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bercle</hi> in the Back, and the greater part ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the <hi>Spleen,</hi> ended in the <hi>Hypoconder</hi> of that ſide. This <hi>Tumour</hi> was ſome years ſince mitigated by the uſe of Aperitives and <hi>Emplaſtrum Nigrum;</hi> Nevertheleſs it ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued painful when I lay on that ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which it would increaſe and decreaſe with the Moon: But ſince my taking the ſix Doſes of <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> no Symptom of that Nature hitherto appears, nor any thing like a <hi>Tumour</hi> remains. The Cure of this, as alſo of the <hi>Cramp,</hi> was indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought on by me then, whoſe trouble and pain were inconſiderable to that other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contain'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94097:21"/>in the firſt part of this Account, but (by the bleſſing of the Almighty) all things wrought together for the benefit of,</p>

               <p>I Have very often been prevented in my deſign of anſwering yours; as to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive Salt, I have found it effectual in heat of Urine more than once, I have given it to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, and to Children in a Tertain Fever, and the ſecond Doſe has put by the Fit; I ſeldom gave leſs than half an Ounce unleſs to Children under ten years; I cured a young Woman of Quality, <hi>in dolore &amp; fluxu Haemorrhoidum,</hi> or bleeding Piles, when all Remedies proved ineffectual, with ſix Doſes of it, half an Ounce to each Doſe without any return; the ſame I did for a Gentleman of Quality of this Country, it being an old, and obſtinate Diſeaſe; I give it to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the <hi>Worms,</hi> and to Perſons in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fevers before any Signs of Concoction, if they be reſtringed, or there be any occaſion for a Solutive; becauſe it does not diſorder
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94097:21"/>the Humours, yet I have known it purge ſome Perſons very much, who have Lax Bowels and are of a weak habit of Body; a young Maid who had a Tumour broak in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal Muſcles of her Breaſt, which I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by her complaint, and by the <hi>pus</hi> that ſhe Cough't up, I cured, by giving her three Doſes of theſe Chryſtals; they cleans'd, and heal'd the <hi>Ulcer,</hi> as I do believe; for want of Appetite, I have given it to very many, and it always procured an Appetite to all, in two or three Doſes taking; one remarkable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of the <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> I had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, it is this: A Gentleman in <hi>Hantſhire</hi> had a Son about four years of Age, whoſe Face ſoon after his Birth was wholly encru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted over with a Scab, which continued not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtandng all the Phyſicians endeavours, and old Womens Medicines in the Country, till it was by me totally cleanſed by <hi>Sal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutivum.</hi> I diſſolved half an Ounce of the Salt in four Ounces of Spring-water, and ordered the Childs Face to be waſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with three times a day; and at the ſame time the Child took the Salt in his Milk from one Dram (by degrees) to two Drams every Morning for three Weeks together, by which means the Scab vaniſhed, and the Childs face became perfectly ſmooth, which I look upon to be an extraordinary effect. I cannot at preſent think of more, becauſe I am in haſt, but I ſhould be glad to hear what Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you, and ſome other Practitioners have

               <p>YOU having acquainted me with a deſign you had to advance the Reputation of wholſome and Salutiferous Medicines, that they might be brought into more common uſe, in the ſtead of thoſe Crude and ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ones too much in Vogue, not only with the meaner ſort, upon whom Cuſtom hath prevailed; but alſo thoſe of a higher form, whoſe profeſſion obliges them to do better, the health and lives of their Patients depending upon it. I muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is great reaſon for all Phyſicians who deſign the good of their Neighbours more than their own private Intereſt, to ſtudy the beſt Remedies they are capable, and the beſt methods for the Adminiſtration thereof: becauſe, next to that of the Cure of Souls, that of a Phyſician, is the moſt careful and worthy Imployment under Heaven: And there is as much reaſon to indeavour a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Reformation therein, as in any thing we can ſet about. Now although this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent undertaking of yours cannot be ſuppoſed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94097:22"/>to effect ſo great a good, yet ſeeing all pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Men know that the greateſt things in this World, are not attained otherwiſe than <hi>Gradatim,</hi> I am not without ſome hopes that the publick knowledge of the uſe and virtues of your <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> may do ſome Service that way, for when by repeated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments it ſhall be found, that this is one of the beſt and ſafeſt of purging Medicines hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to made uſe of; It may not only ſerve to ſtop the Mouths of thoſe who abuſe the World, by telling them that Chymical Remedies are dangerous; but may excite the more inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to bring into uſe, thoſe more excellent and Salutiferous Preparations your ſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are Philoſophers by Fire can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with, for the good of their Patients. I ſhall therefore give in Evidence ſome few of thoſe many Teſtimonies I have to offer in its juſt defence.</p>
               <p>About Seven years ſince I had a Patient whoſe Leggs were much ſwelled and pitted, with other Symptoms which commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that ſort of Dropſie called <hi>Anaſarca.</hi> I ordered him to take half an Ounce of your Salt, which purged him very kindly; after that ſix Drams of the ſame, with the like Operation; and after that he took a whole Ounce, and by thoſe three Doſes he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, and ſo continued, without any other Medicine.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:94097:23"/>
               <p>A Gentlewoman about fifty years old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubled with a general indiſpoſition of Body, a great oppreſſion at her Stomach, with want of Appetite, after other Medicines had proved ineffectual, I ordered her to take of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Sal Solutivum</hi> every Morning in a draught of water, which accordingly ſhe did, and was cured in a bout ten days.</p>
               <p>I have reaſon alſo to commend its uſe, in thoſe who are troubled with heat and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Urine; it commonly giving them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief aſſoon as moſt Remedies that are uſed, if it be timely and prudently adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Yellow Jaundiſe,</hi> I believe there are few better Remedies; as will appear by the Tryal I made of it upon my ſelf. Laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer I was ſorely afflicted with a deep Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and after ſome time fell into the <hi>Yellow Jaundiſe:</hi> I uſed thoſe Remedies with which I cured others, but to me they proved ineffectual: But at length I took three Doſes of your <hi>Sal Solutivum,</hi> by which (through the Bleſſing of God) I was perfectly cured. And perhaps it may not be ungrateful to the Sons of Art, to give a brief Account of the <hi>Modus operandi.</hi> The firſt Doſe did Vomit and purge from Morning, till about 4 or 5 in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, which indeed was an unuſual and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary way of Operation, I having never known it do ſo before, either in my ſelf or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But when I ſaw that the matter ejected by Vomit was as yellow as Saffron, I was well pleaſed with its Operation. I opened a Vein
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94097:23"/>about ſix that Evening, and the <hi>Serum Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> was as yellow as the matter of the Vomit. I adventured notwithſtanding in two days time to take the ſame Doſe as before; It did not vomit me at all, but only gave me about four or five Stools: The laſt I took gave me about three or four Stools: without that uſual gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and ſickneſs, which commonly attends ordinary <hi>Catharticks,</hi> and ſo I was freed from that afflicting Diſeaſe: as alſo that Melancholy which attended me: The Doſe I took was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an Ounce at a time. I thought good to add this, as an Incouragement to thoſe, who underſtand true Medicine, that they may not think otherwiſe of it than they ought; for by this it is manifeſt that your Salt hath variety of ways to exert its Vertue, where it meets with variety of Matter. And although I have for ſome conſiderable time, been in the purſuit of ſome <hi>Arcana</hi>'s in which I have not been wholly fruſtrate in my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and therefore cannot be ſuppoſed fond of any ſingle Remedy, ſo as to take up with it: Yet I muſt confeſs (where purging is neceſſary) I would, for its ſafeneſs and uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, recommend your Salt before any thing I yet know; becauſe it doth good, and no hurt, to whomſoever it hath been Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, as by reiterated Experiments hath been found,</p>

               <p>It hath always been highly approv'd for that excellent Property beyond all other Purgatives that it leaves the Body Laxative; and when taken in a ſufficient quantity work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth certainly, and copiouſly without Sickneſs, Gripings or any Diſcompoſure, leaving the Stomach ſenſibly ſtronger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not liable to taking of Colds, or any neceſſity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement as is uſual with other Purgatives.</p>
               <p>I have found it of excellent Service in the <hi>Iliack Paſſion,</hi> making way through, or rather diſſolving the moſt indurated or ſtubborn Obſtructions of the Inteſtines, being given in a large Doſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Itch</hi> I have never known any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means to equal it, being taken daily for a Fortnight together.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Uterine Obſtructions,</hi> I have prov'd it of very great Service, and ſometime ſpeedy to a wonder, effecting the work the very firſt Doſe.</p>
               <p>I have alſo known it to reſolve very large Tumours of the Neck (ſuppoſed to ariſe from Cold, but I am well aſſured, that in one it was Scrophulous) by taking one or two large Doſes in the Morning in their Water Gruel, in which it always works beſt.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:94097:24"/>

               <p>By which excellent Diſcourſe, that noble Philoſopher ſetteth forth two things: Firſt, that the <hi>Sulphurs</hi> of <hi>Metals</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrected by the Artiſt, and brought to the higheſt perfection, <hi>viz.</hi> Fixation do then univerſally cure all Diſeaſes. Secondly, that they exert this wonderful Vertue after the manner of a ſhining light, which enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all dark places and corners, that even ſo the <hi>Mineral Sulphurs,</hi> purify'd corrected and fixt, by their Splendour and Light (which the Almighty hath endowed them with) do irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and enlighten the <hi>Archeus,</hi> which is darkned and obumbrated by Diſeaſes, inject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Powers of light into it, and raiſing it as it were to a new Life. For the Nature of all <hi>Metallick</hi> and <hi>Mineral Sulphurs</hi> is like unto that of the Stars; for as the Stars are fire and light, ſo likewiſe the <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> as thoſe do warm and enlighten, ſo theſe; as the Nature
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94097:26"/>of thoſe is to vivifie and quicken, becauſe they are altogether light and life, a Spring of quickening Vertue, ſo likewiſe the <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> when freed from their Impediments, can do no other, but warm enlighten and vivifie. But that the ſubject of my Diſcourſe may be the better underſtood, I think it neceſſary here briefly to declare what I intend by <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sulphurs:</hi> know then that I underſtand a ſoft Fat, or Oleaginous inflamable Matter created of one Subſtance, to wit, of the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, thick or earthy, or lower Fire, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Severation of the Chaos, which I take to be the Mother and firſt Riſe of all the <hi>Mineral Sulphurs;</hi> which are totally of one Nature, Deſcent and Original, and of one Subſtance; even as the Stars are created of one and the ſame Subſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of the more ſubtil and celeſtial Fire, which in the moving of the <hi>Fiat</hi> upon the Chaos mounted upwards; ſo that the Stars and the <hi>Sulphurs</hi> agree in the two Properties of warming and enlightening. This Sulphurous ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Vertue of the central Fire always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on motion in the Bowels of the Earth, meets with the Metalline or Mineral Juices, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in their proper Matrixes, adheres to them, coagulates them, and continually abides with them, until they have attained to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; or elſe being taken immature out of their Mines, is in part forced from them by the Fire of melting, which together with their
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94097:27"/>mineral Earth, turns into an <hi>Opake</hi> Glaſſy Cinder; the other part abiding ſtill with the refined Metal or Mineral, which is that which I call a <hi>Metalline</hi> or <hi>Mineral Sulphur,</hi> Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating it in particular, according to the Metal or Mineral, to which it is joyned, as the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> of <hi>Venus, Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Sulphur</hi> I take to be the Agent or Fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which Metals are in their Mines firſt coagulated, then gradually and continually cocted and maturated, till by length of time they acquire a Metallick hardneſs, and Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leability, or elſe obtain the ultimate perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Metals, which is purity and fixity, and then having no further need of this Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Agnet it is Spontaneouſly ſeparated from them, as is manifeſt in the Oars of Gold and Silver (Gold eſpecially) thoſe Metals being ſometimes found in pure Bodies, their Agent being totally ſeparated.</p>
               <p>That this Sulphurous Agent in part remains cloſely combin'd with the inferior Metals af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their ſmelting from their Oars, appears in the hard Metals as <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> by their being ſcorify'd in their Ignition, or by the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s that ſail from them, when heat red hot and hammered upon an Anvil; the ſame thing may be obſerved in the <hi>Flux</hi> of the ſol: Metals; for if you melt Tin or Lead with ſuch a Fire as will keep it red hot, and when the Metal flows keep it continually ſtirring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a ſhort time all the Metal will be reduced
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:94097:27"/>to a Calx or Aſhes. Now if any one ſhall think, that this Incineration of the Metal is to be attributed only to the power of the Fire, and not to its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> let him try if he can by any degree of Fire thus reduce Gold and Silver to a Calx, which want this external <hi>Sulphur,</hi> having laid it aſide as a uſeleſs Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If he ſhall reply, that as the Bodies of Gold and Silver being perfect, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Fire, ſo neither are they hurt by <hi>Sulphur</hi> (eſpecially Gold which is not at all diminiſhed by ſuffering a Cementation with <hi>Sulphur</hi>) and therefore it is not <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the inferior Metals, that reduceth them into <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> or Aſhes, but the Action of the Fire which tranſpoſeth the parts, or altereth the Texture of thoſe Metals, which are unfixt and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and therefore want a ſtability to reſiſt the Power of the Fire. I anſwer, tis true, the perfect Metals are not deſtroyed by <hi>Sulphur,</hi> but are again ſet free from it upon the Teſt by <hi>Saturn,</hi> to which it preſently adheres, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it into <hi>Scoria,</hi> and leaving the Gold or Silver unaltered. But notwithſtanding this, there is no <hi>Goldſmith</hi> but will tell you to his trouble, how eager or brittle <hi>Sulphur</hi> will make Silver and Gold: And indeed ſo brittle, that if upon Silver or Gold in <hi>Flux, Sulphur</hi> be multiply'd, the Metal may be beaten to Powder in a Mortar, which is enough for my purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove the Exiſtence of a <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the inferior Metals, by its
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:94097:28"/>Power of ſcorifying or incinerating their Bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies. Another way by which theſe <hi>Sulphurs</hi> are manifeſt is by their Flame, when the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are in a ſtrong Fire; Copper emits a green Flame, Tin a purple colour'd one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some of the ancient Philoſophers have called this univerſal Sulphurous Agent, <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogorgon,</hi> or the God of the Earth, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to it Health, Wealth, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and without doubt they wanted not their Reaſons for ſo doing: but my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe being only to ſhew that this Terreſtrial Fire, as it adheres to Metals and Minerals affords an excellent Medicine againſt Diſeaſes, I ſhall not enquire into its further Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And although thoſe <hi>Sulphurs</hi> be neceſſary to the Metals, as a digeſting, maturating or ripening Agent, yet I think them not to be of the Eſſence of the Metal, to which they ſo cloſely adhere, but to be highly endowed with Vertues for curing Diſeaſes; having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their common Power of warming and enlightening, received ſpecial Gifts and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities from the <hi>Aſtrums</hi> of thoſe Metals with which they are con-coagulated: for if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Sulphurs</hi> were Eſſential to the Metallick form as the Internal are, then they could not be ſeparated from the Metal nor any part of them, but the Metal would be deſtroyed, but I have divers times ſeen the contrary, whence I conclude, that they are not Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:94097:28"/>to the Metal. For I have ſometimes by Calcination with <hi>Niter,</hi> ſometimes by other Salts ſeparated much of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> from Tin; afterwards I have reduced the Tin again to a Body (although it be ſomewhat difficult, by reaſon of the Action of the burning <hi>Sulphur</hi>) and have found it ſo far from being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it hath been much mended both in the Colour, Hardneſs, and Sound; in which it hath in ſome degree emulated Silver. I have alſo by the help of a certain <hi>Menſtruum</hi> known to me, ſeparated the <hi>Sulphur</hi> from Copper, but the form of the Copper was not deſtroyed but meliorated, the Metal being more Ductile and of a greater Splendour than it was before, and if the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> be divers times repeated upon the <hi>Calx,</hi> till all the external <hi>Sulphur</hi> be ſeparated, and the <hi>Calx</hi> then again reduced to a Metal, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal will be white, hard, and ductile like Silver, but yet formally diſtinct from Silver as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a due Fixity: Neither can thoſe <hi>Sulphurs</hi> when thus ſeparated, by any Art be reduced <hi>per ſe</hi> into a Metal: Hence I conclude, that they have other Ends and Appointments from the great Creator, than what are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Metals; to wit, to cure the Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of humane Bodies. This opinion of mine is confirmed by the excellent <hi>Helmont, de Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiaſi, Cap.</hi> 8. § 8. ſpeaking of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> where he hath theſe Words: <hi>Cum</hi> Sulphur <hi>iſtud externum, quale è Cupro trahitur,

                  <q>Seeing that the external Sulphur (ſuch as is drawn from Copper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a perfect Metal; but is joyned to the Copper by God, therefore that Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur muſt neceſſarily have its own Ends, conducing to the neceſſities of ungrateful Man, to wit, for his Diſeaſes and Infirmities, above all Dignity of the <hi>Metallick</hi> perfection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this is not only true of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the other inferior Metals, that God hath appointed them for Medicine, but of Minerals alſo, even from common <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to the Sulphur of the <hi>Electrum Minerale im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maturum</hi> or <hi>Lili</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> which are the higheſt and loweſt Boundaries of the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of mineral Sulphurs, notwithſtanding which thoſe Sulphurs differ greatly among themſelves in their Dignity and Power: for the Sulphur of <hi>Antimony</hi> exceeds the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sulphur</hi> in light and vertue, as far as Nature in their firſt Generation hath more highly ſtated, and nobilitated the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than the latter; the difference being the ſame as between a raw and a roaſted piece of meat for the nouriſhing of our Bodies. For although the Sulphur of <hi>Antimony,</hi> be as well
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94097:29"/>Volatile and Combuſtible as the <hi>Common Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and ſo no difference between them as to their fixity and maturity; yet ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is in their Vertue, that the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur of <hi>Antimony</hi> as ſoon as it is ſeparated from its mercurial Body, being given to the Patient without any further Preparation is of much quicker and powerfuller Operation than the <hi>Common Sulphur,</hi> although often ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed; which proceedeth from no other, but its inbred Excellency wherewith it hath been endowed by Nature: ſo alſo the Sulphur of <hi>Venus</hi> hath a greater Vertue than that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> and that of the <hi>Electrum Minerale immaturum</hi> hath a Power and Vertue more eminent than any of the reſt. For as the Almighty God in the beginning, created all the Stars of one Matter and Subſtance, <hi>i. e.</hi> of a ſubtile Fiery light, and yet made one more glorious, powerful and ſplendid than another; even ſo hath he done with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick and mineral Sulphurs, which he hath alſo created of one Subſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> of a groſs and earthy thick Fiery light, but yet withal hath framed the one more glorious and more vertuous than the other, attributing to each its particular Glory, which it cannot exceed though prepared and perfected as much as is poſſible by Art; inſomuch that no Sulphur can take more Vertue than the Creator hath endowed it with in its firſt Formation: and as you ſee that one Star exceedeth another in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:94097:30"/>Beauty and Splendour, ſo likewiſe one Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur ſurpaſſeth another in its Vertue and Energy of healing.</p>
               <p>Now as you ſee that among the Stars the moſt glorious is the Sun, which greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth all the reſt in Light Vertue, and Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, being the Root, Source and heart of the Stars, whence they all did flow, and is as their Father in regard of their Original, and their King in reſpect of its great Pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in Splendour: even ſo the Metals and Minerals alſo have their King and Father, which ſurpaſſeth them all, and therefore is by <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> called <hi>Electrum Minerale immaturum, Metallus Primus, Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Maſculus,</hi> which ſignifieth the firſt, or the Father of the Metals; and ſo of right may be called the King of the mineral Kingdom, in regard that this proceedeth from it: even as a Tree ſpringeth from its Root; for which reaſon <hi>Helmont</hi> ſets down this heavenly Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, in the Front of his Catalogue of the <hi>Arcanums</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> calling it <hi>Eſſentia Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brorum,</hi> becauſe that nothing doth ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly ſtrengthen all the Members as this Royal Tincture, when brought unto its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, we may Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, 1. That Mineral Sulphurs are Subjects endowed by the Almighty, with great Vertue in the curing of Diſeaſes. 2. That this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is environed, and kept from us by a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94097:30"/>virulency, ſo that none of them can be of Medicinal uſe to us without a due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, their inward Light and Vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guarded by a virulent Poyſon, like the paradiſical Tree of Life by a flaming Sword. 3. That this <hi>Exotick</hi> virulency being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Sulphurs perfected, they cure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes <hi>ad Modum Radii,</hi> without being dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed either in Subſtance or Weight, but paſs through the ſeveral Digeſtions of the Body unaltered in their quantity, and unchanged in their Celeſtial Power and Vertue. 4. That thoſe great Powers and Vertues have their Riſe from the inviſible heavenly Subſtance of the Sulphurs, having their Root nearer to the interior heavenly World, than all other viſible, tangible and corruptible things, and therefore nearer to the Divine Goodneſs, as thoſe words of <hi>Helmont</hi> intimate. <hi>Adeoque teſtantur ejuſmodi Arcana, ſe infinitae bonitati propinqua,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now as thoſe prepared Sulphurs act efficiently, <hi>ad Modum Luminis in Archeum,</hi> ſtriking at the very Ideas of Diſeaſes, ſo they induce and enable the <hi>Archeus,</hi> or <hi>Vital Spirit</hi> to perform its own Acts, and do Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally warm, digeſt, concoct, reſolve, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, dulcifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whence the material cauſe of Diſeaſes, or diſeaſy Matter, in which the Idea acts, is gradually altered and ſeparated, by the daily taking of theſe Sulphurs for a due time; whence the <hi>Palſy, Epilepſy, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94097:31"/>Conſumption, Aſthma, Dropſy, Leproſy, Gout,</hi> and other grievous Diſeaſes may be eradicated. And to this purpoſe any of the mineral or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Sulphurs may be uſed, provided they are duly prepared, for we are not obliged to ſeek ſuch a Sulphur in Gold, nor is there a neceſſity of uſing that of the other hard Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, (although they well recompence the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Charge of extracting and preparing) but our merciful Creator hath been very boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in giving us great Variety of Subjects, from which this Sulphur may be gotten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Metals, as <hi>Common Sulphur, Vitriol, Lapis H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94097:31"/>Ranks or Claſſes. The firſt of theſe contains the Sulphurs ſeparated from their Bodies, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and unlocked, Volatile and Inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, digeſted, corrected, and ſpoyled of their mineral Malignancy, and made ſafe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Remedies for the curing of Diſeaſes; whoſe Doſe is ſmall, being for thoſe of ripe years, but from two to four Grains, or ſix as the higheſt, and pleaſant in Operation, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the moſt part by gentle breathing Sweats, or inſenſible Tranſpiration, never by Vomit, unleſs where Nature is prediſpoſed to that Evacuation by ſome indigeſted or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Matter in the Ventricle; but when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath once made her intended Separation, they then cauſe Vomiting no more. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute Diſeaſes, as <hi>Fevers, Fluxes, Pluriſies, Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humations,</hi> &amp;c. they are to be taken a Grain or two every three or four hours in a ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of a ſuitable <hi>Vehicle,</hi> ſo long till the Diſeaſe is overcome, and ſigns of Recovery appear, and then once or twice a day till perfect Reſtoration. In <hi>Chronick</hi> Diſtempers two Grains in the Morning faſting, and three or four Grains at Night going to Bed, in a Glaſs of Canary or Sherry; but that which is elicited from the <hi>Common Sulphur,</hi> being leſs active than the reſt, may be taken from ſix to twelve Grains.</p>
               <p>This appearance of the Sulphurs is in the form of a ſubtile tinging Powder, and thus prepared; I conſtantly keep by me the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94097:32"/>of <hi>Venus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> and purpoſe to do the like by thoſe of <hi>Vitriol, Zink</hi> and native <hi>Cinabar,</hi> having at divers times heretofore prepared them all by the help of the ſame <hi>Alcaheſtick Menſtruum:</hi> I call the <hi>Menſtruum Alcaheſtick,</hi> becauſe in many things it agrees with the <hi>Alcaheſt</hi> of <hi>Paracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> but not in all the Properties which are attributed to that, wherefore I do not believe it to be the ſame; but in ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sulphurs from Minerals and Metals, and correcting their virulency it is equal to that, and to me much better, who am a Poſſeſſor of this, but pretend not to that. This I thought neceſſary to mention in this place, to ſave my ſelf and others the trouble of curious Queſtions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Rank or Order of theſe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, is the Preparation of the firſt Order, Philoſophically diſſolved and brought over the Helm, in the form of an highly tinged red Oyl or Tincture, which is diſſolvable in Wine and other Liquors, but may be moſt commodiouſly taken upon the point of a Knife mixed with a little fine Sugar. The Doſe is from 10 to 20 Drops. In this form it is more penetrant, and its light much more diffuſive than in the former, and therefore much more prevalent in the Cure of <hi>Chronick</hi> and fixt Diſeaſes, as the <hi>Epilepſy, Palſy, Aſthma, Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Dropſie, Gout, Rhumatiſm,</hi> and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacious Diſeaſes of the <hi>Genus-Nervoſum,</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:94097:32"/>
                  <hi>Viſcera. N. B.</hi> That when the Sulphurs are brought to this form, <hi>Baſilius</hi> calls them <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae Metallorum,</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> their <hi>Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Ignis.</hi> And thus far my Experience hath reached in the Preparation of theſe Sulphurs; and in this form alſo I intend (God willing) to prepare them and keep them by me, for the Aſſiſtance of ſuch Phyſicians as are mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe them. And here I cannot paſs by ſomewhat worthy of Note, which I have lately obſerved of the red Oyl, or <hi>Anima</hi> of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is, that a little of it mixed with ſome other convenient matter, and rubbed upon Rhumatick and other pains hath given preſent eaſe, and in two or three days hath quite removed them: and I am in great hopes that it will give eaſe in the dolorous Gout, to ſuch a Degree that the Patient may conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſt in the uſe of ſuch inward Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as may remove the cauſe, of which ſort are the Sulphurs of which I am Diſcourſing. But of this I have not yet had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be made certain by Tryal.</p>
               <p>The third Order or Degree is, when the red Oyl or <hi>Anima</hi> of the ſecond Degree, is brought to a State of Incombuſtibility and Fixity, and then it is, and not till then, that they have attained thoſe Superlative Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in healing, which <hi>Helmont</hi> attributes to them; yet the loweſt of thoſe Orders is not without its eminent Vertues (compared with ordinary Medicines) in curing Diſeaſes. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:94097:33"/>the bringing the Sulphurs, or any of them, to this fixed and permanent State, which is their ultimate perfection, I do not pretend to have done, for it requires more time, and perhaps more Art than I am furniſhed with to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them, neither do I profeſs to prepare the Sulphur, <hi>Electri Mineralis immaturi ſive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talli Maſculi,</hi> concerning which Subject, Men that have ventured to name it, I find have greatly differed. But among my Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mineral Sulphurs, I content my ſelf by way of Eminency or Preference, with my <hi>Aſtrum Minerale,</hi> whoſe Doſe is from three to ſix Grains in the firſt form above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and from ten to twenty Drops in the ſecond form. But as that is the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Vertue of the Sulphurs which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, ſo it alſo is the deareſt, being to be made but in ſmall quantities with much labour and time: but my <hi>Species Univerſalis,</hi> having all the Properties of the mineral Sulphurs, may ſerve <hi>Inſtar omnium,</hi> where they cannot be had; the difference being only in the Doſe, which is much larger than that of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, and the Vertue ſomewhat leſs potent as being more extended. Alſo my <hi>Tinctura Metallica,</hi> being a Solution of the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts of <hi>Metallick</hi> Sulphurs in Spirit of Wine, may be uſed in Diſeaſes of the Nerves, and all others ariſing from Congelation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the <hi>Animae Metallorum</hi> of the ſecond form, and is a very pleaſant and efficacious
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:94097:33"/>Medicine; the Vertues and Uſes of which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Species Univerſalis</hi> are deſcrib'd at large, in the Appendix to my Catalogue of Medicines, Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1684, to which I refer the Reader; which Directions may alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently ſerve for the uſe of the mineral Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, either in the form of Powder or Drops, by obſerving their Doſes above ſet down, and varying them in proportion with the Species and Tincture. But if it ſhall pleaſe God to grant me Life, and proſper my Labours and Studies; I hope I may hereafter be able to give ſuch an Account of ſome of the higher <hi>Arcana</hi> in Medicine, as may be profitable to the Miſeries of the Sick, and afford ſome ſatisfaction to well-minded Phyſicians.</p>
               <p>I think it here convenient to advertiſe that in <hi>Chronick</hi> Diſeaſes, where the mineral Sulphurs are to be uſed, if the firſt paſſages of the Body be well cleanſed by the <hi>Sal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutivum,</hi> and the Obſtructions of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> and Veſſels opened, the Sulphurs will much more readily diſplay their Vertues, and the time of the Cure will be ſhortened.</p>
               <p>I have ſpent many years in the ſearch of a ſafe, pleaſant, and effectual Preparation of the vulgar <hi>Mercury,</hi> that might like the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum Corallinum,</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Diaphoret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> cure the <hi>Pox, Cancer, Noli me tangere,</hi> &amp;c. and although among the many Tryals I have made, I have obtained ſomewhat which
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:94097:34"/>hath done things notable, yet it hath not compleatly anſwered the End of my Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But I have at length found out a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Medicine, which I hope will fully anſwer my longing Expectation: It is ſweet in Taſte, and fixed, although not with a compleat Fixity ſo as to abide a very ſtrong Fire, for I have ſometime pleaſed my ſelf with ſuch a fixed <hi>Mercury,</hi> as would abide the Fire of a Coppel in form of a Powder, but I could obſerve but little effect it had in Phyſick. This of which I am now ſpeaking operates very gently, ſometimes by Stools, and ſometimes by Sweats, and according to the Tryals I have yet had of it, doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vomit nor Salivate; as to its particular Vertues, Doſe, and manner of adminiſtring, if it ſhall after reiterated Experiments compleat my Deſires, I ſhall publiſh an Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with my <hi>Balſamum Veneris Anodynum</hi> above-mentioned, which is alſo now under Probation. And in order to this, I make it my requeſt to ſuch ingenious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, as love the Propagation and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Medicine, that they would give thoſe two Medicines a fair Tryal, and make ſuch report thereof to me, as they ſhall be found to merit; by which means I ſhall be able to furniſh the ſaid Account much ſooner and better than my own ſingle Obſervations will enable me to do. But I ſhall here ſay no more of them, leſt I fall under the ſame
